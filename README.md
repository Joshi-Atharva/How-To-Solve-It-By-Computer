# How to Solve it by Computer by R.G.Dromey

## Introduction


How to Solve it by Computer is a computer science book by R. G. Dromey

It is an introduction to the whys of algorithms and data structures. Features of the book:

    1. The design factors associated with problems
    2. The creative process behind coming up with innovative solutions for algorithms and data structures
    3. The line of reasoning behind the constraints, factors, and design choices made.
The very fundamental algorithms portrayed by this book are mostly presented in pseudocode and/or Pascal notation.
In this book, the Chapters are ordered in increasing order of conceptual difficulty as usually experienced by students.
